# lets-draw

My solution to coding problem

## Installation

lets-draw requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the app.

```sh
cd lets-draw 
yarn 
yarn start
```


## Time spend on this assignment
- 0:30 reading the assignment, plan the solution, small research about console input handling
- 0:45h setting up the environment (typescript, eslint, prettier)
- 3:15h creating functions, testing, code cleanup 
- 1:00h creating repository (repository, ssh, gitignore, readme)
- **Total: 5:30**
 
## Major drawbacks
- I have never tried (in typescript) to insert text in console.
- setting up the environment took me longer than I would anticipate. Mainly setting eslint and prettier to work together.
- coding part was quite easy and I genuinely enjoy it. Small drawback was handling the X and Y axes.
- I could not create/import my ssh key and push the commit. This was the only frustrating part of the assignment.

## Improvements
- the error messages could be more meaningful
- use prompt-sync-history to store and use previous commands
